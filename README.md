### Synthesis and Analysis problems:

<p>All about y = Ma, where M = np.outer(ts, ys), a is the amplitude</p>

Each column in M contains a complex sinusoid ($Ae^{i2ft}$), with a particular frequency, evaluated at a sequency of ts.<br>
Each element in y is the sum of several complex sinusoid, evaluated at a particular time.
